Framework Core

To begin, duplicate `sample-environment.ph` and `sample-app.com` outside of the samples/ folder so that they're parallel to core/


Example:

  root/
    core/
    sample-environment.php
    sample-app.com

Then, rename `sample-environment.php` to `environment.php` and `sample-app.com` to whatever your app name is.

Finally, point your host/localhost to your app folder to begin.
